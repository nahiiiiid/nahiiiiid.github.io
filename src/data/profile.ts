    "I build software like a precision instrument: define the system boundary, model constraints, implement with correctness, and verify outcomes.",
    "I design interfaces that feel like developer workstations — clean, fast, keyboard-friendly, and structured. On the backend, I prefer clear abstractions and measurable performance.",
    "On the research side, I focus on rigorous evaluation and leakage-aware experimentation, especially in CPS/IoT security and behavioral trust modeling.",
